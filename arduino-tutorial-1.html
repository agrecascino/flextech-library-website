    <h1>Arduino Tutorial 1: Introduction to Arduino</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the FlexTech Library's introductory Arduino tutorial. The intention of this tutorial is to familiarize students with the basics of an Arduino Uno Microcontroller.</p>

    <h3>Required Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno Microcontroller</li>
        <li>USB A/B Cable</li>
        <li>A Functioning Computer with a USB A port.</li>
        <li><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="blank">Arduino Software</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hardware</h3>

    <p>Let's take a minute to get ourselves familiar with the hardware. The Arduino Uno Microcontroller is a small function machine that is designed to retain and execute a code, and read and write to and from different inputs and outputs. The physical board has many pins on it, where you can plug in either inputs or outputs for power or electrical signals. It also has a USB B port, for use with a computer, and a power port, which is used when you need to power the arduino without a computer. The Arduino also has a 'reset' button, which is located right next to the large USB B port. This button is used to stop and restart the code. In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the USB B port, the pin labeled '13', and the yellow LED associated with pin 13.</p>
    <p>The cable we will be using to connect our Arduino to the computer is a USB A/B cable. This cable has a USB A connector (the flat and rectangular plug) and a USB B connector (the taller and more square plug). The USB B connector goes into the Arduino, while the USB A connector goes into the computer.

    <h3>Software*</h3>
    <p>To make a program in Arduino, we have to have the Arduino Software, which can be downloaded <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="blank">here</a> for free. Once downloaded, move the Arduino application into your 'Applications' folder. Launch the Arduino program by double-clicking it. Once the program is open, you can save your sketch by pressing 'command-s'. The sketch should automatically be saved in a folder named 'Arduino' in your 'Documents' folder.</p>
