    <h1>Arduino Tutorial 1: Introduction to Arduino</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to the FlexTech Library's introductory Arduino tutorial. The intention of this tutorial is to familiarize students with the basics of an Arduino Uno Microcontroller.</p>
    
    <h3>Required Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno Microcontroller</li>
        <li>USB A/B Cable</li>
        <li>A Functioning Computer with a USB A port.</li>
        <li><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="blank">Arduino Software</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Hardware</h3>
    
    <p>Let's take a minute to get ourselves familiar with the hardware. The Arduino Uno Microcontroller is a small function machine that is designed to retain and execute a code, and read and write to and from different inputs and outputs. The physical board has many pins on it, where you can plug in either inputs or outputs. It also has a USB B port, for use with a computer, and a power port, which is used when you need to power the arduino without a computer...</p>
